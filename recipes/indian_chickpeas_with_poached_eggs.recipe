# method
# 1. Heat the oil in a non-stick sauté pan, add the garlic, 
# pepper, chilli and the whites from the spring onions,
# and fry for 5 mins over a medium-high heat.
# Meanwhile, put a large pan of water on to boil.
# 
# 2. Add the spices, tomatoes, most of the coriander and
# the chickpeas to the sauté pan and cook for 1-2 mins more.
# Stir in the bouillon powder and enough liquid from the
# chickpeas to moisten everything, and leave to simmer gently.
# 
# 3. Once the water is at a rolling boil, crack in your
# eggs and poach for 2 mins, then remove with a
# slotted spoon. Stir the spring onion tops into the chickpeas,
# then very lightly crush a few of the chickpeas with a
# fork or potato masher. Spoon the chickpea mixture onto plates,
# scatter with the reserved coriander and top with the eggs.
# Serve with an extra sprinkle of cumin, if you like.
