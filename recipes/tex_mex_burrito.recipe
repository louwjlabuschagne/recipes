# method
# 1. In a small bowl, mix the tomatoes,
# half the spring onions and half the red chilli
# with some seasoning and set aside. Beat the
# eggs and milk with a fork with some seasoning.

# 2. Heat the oil in a large non-stick pan and fry
# the remaining spring onion and chilli for 1 min,
# then pour in the egg mix. Gently scramble the eggs
# by dragging the egg mixture as it sets into the middle
# of the pan. Cook to your liking, then take off the
# heat and throw on the cheese. Stir through, then
# divide between the wraps. Tuck up the top and bottom
# of each wrap and roll up, then slice in half and serve
# with the homemade tomato salsa, soured cream and guacamole, if you like.
